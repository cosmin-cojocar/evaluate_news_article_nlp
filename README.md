# Evaluate News Article with NLP
A web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. This tool will give us back pertinent information about the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.
